# RustyTunes — Code Structure & Conventions

This file defines the project's structural conventions. Apply them when
adding new code or modifying existing code. Reorganize new modules to fit
this layout rather than inventing new top-level folders.

## Module layout

We use the Rust 2018+ style: a parent module lives in `<name>.rs` next
to its `<name>/` subfolder of children — never inside it as `mod.rs`.
See <https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html>.

## Conventions

1. **Embeds**: All Discord embeds live under `embeds/`. Group them in
   subfolders that mirror the feature area (`embeds/music/queue_embed.rs`,
   `embeds/activity/break_embed.rs`). Do not define embeds inline inside
   commands or services — define a variant on the feature's embed enum and
   call `.to_embed()` from there.

2. **Utils**: When a helper is used by more than one service or command,
   move it to `utils/` and group by topic (`utils/time_utils.rs`,
   `utils/string_utils.rs`). Helpers used by exactly one module stay local
   to that module. Each topic file should expose stateless, pure
   functions — no Discord types, no I/O.

3. **Handlers**: Every event handler — Serenity `FullEvent`, Songbird
   `EventHandler`, poise error/lifecycle hooks — lives in `handlers/`.
   `bot.rs` should not contain inline event-handling logic; delegate to a
   `handlers/<name>_handler.rs` entry point.

4. **Services vs commands**: Commands are thin orchestrators. They:
   - Parse arguments and validate via `checks/`.
   - Call into `service/`, `player/`, or `sources/` to do the work.
   - Send embeds via `service::embed_service::SendEmbed`.

   Substantive logic (loops, retry handling, multi-step flows, state
   mutation) belongs in a service. If a command grows beyond ~50 lines or
   acquires nested helpers, push the body into a service.

5. **Sources**: Track origins (`spotify`, `youtube`, `local`) live in
   `sources/`. Both commands and services may call into them. A new source
   gets its own `sources/<name>/` subfolder with a `<name>_client.rs`
   entry point.

6. **Coupled commands stay together**: When commands hand off to each
   other (`break` ends and auto-starts `gather`), put them in a shared
   `commands/<feature>/` folder. Don't split them across `utility/` and
   another folder just because the entry points have different names.

7. **Checks**: The `checks/` folder contains *only* check functions used
   by `#[poise::command(... check = "…")]` and by interactive button
   handlers. Determinations of "is this action doable right now" go here.
   Lower-level state predicates that the player uses internally to guard
   its own methods stay on `Player`.

8. **Module names**: Files keep their `_service`, `_handler`, `_embed`,
   `_client`, `_checks`, `_utils` suffix in the filename so the role is
   obvious in `use` statements. Picking the right suffix is part of
   choosing the right folder.

   No `mod.rs`. A module that has children lives in `<name>.rs` next to
   the `<name>/` folder it owns. Never add a `mod.rs` inside the folder.

9. **Player folder**: `player/` is only for the music bot's playback
   engine — the `Player` state machine and the value types (`Track`,
   `Playlist`, `TrackSource`, `PlaybackError`) it owns. Anything that
   isn't part of playing audio (notifications, reminders, gather/break
   state) belongs in `service/`. Split long files in `player/` by topic
   (state machine vs. data types) rather than letting them grow.

## Formatting

`rustfmt.toml` pins `max_width = 200`. A GitHub Action
(`.github/workflows/fmt.yml`) runs `cargo fmt --all` on every push to
`master` and auto-commits any changes as `style: cargo fmt`. Feature
branches don't need to be perfectly formatted — that gets ironed out on
merge — but running `cargo fmt` locally keeps diffs small.

## Adding a feature: checklist

- Embeds go in `embeds/<area>/<feature>_embed.rs`.
- Business logic goes in `service/<feature>_service.rs` (or extends an
  existing service when it fits).
- Source-specific code goes in `sources/<source>/<source>_client.rs`.
- Event/listener code goes in `handlers/<event>_handler.rs`.
- Command file in `commands/<area>/cmd_<name>.rs` that calls the service.
- Shared helpers (time, string, parsing) extract into `utils/`.
- Register the command in `bot.rs`.

If a refactor would violate any of the above, fix the layout first and
then make the change.
